    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to [Healthcare Center Name]! This project is part of my final year work as a B.Sc. Computer Science student at BK Birla College of Arts, Science, and Commerce. I've developed this tool to help predict diseases based on the symptoms that people have.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is This Project About?</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to create a system that can assist doctors and healthcare professionals by providing predictions about possible diseases based on the symptoms reported by patients. It's designed to be simple to use and to give useful information that can help in making medical decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Started This Project</h2>
    <p>
        I started this project because I wanted to combine my interests in technology and healthcare. As a student, I noticed that there are many ways technology can make a difference in healthcare. This project was a way for me to explore how we can use computer science to improve medical diagnostics and support doctors in their work.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes This Project Special</h2>
    <p>
        What makes this project special is that it's developed as part of my academic work. I’ve put a lot of effort into making sure it's practical and useful. It’s not just a theoretical project; it’s something that could potentially be used in real-world scenarios to help with disease prediction.
    </p>
